## Wireframes 
The app will be a single screen with various sequencers. A space bar will toggle start for all sequencers and have a cursor to visually represent the playback's position in the the grid. The right side of the drum sequencer there will be a bpm adjuster as well as buttons for different samples (3) for each part of the drums. There will be a button to clear every "cell" in the sequencer as well. Users can click an occupied cell and use directional keys to further adjust the note in 2 increments (earlier or later). A modal will be incorporated explaining the app and its functionalities. 


## Implementation Timeline 

### Day 1: 
  - Setup session to work with Tone.js and p5. 
  - Create a sequencer for the drums, and figure out having inner "grids" inside of a cell 
  - Create a bpm slider 
  - Incorporate the samples and switching from sample to sample 
  - Create buttons for each sample 
  - Style the sequencer and buttons (simple) 
  
### Day 2: 
  - Research Tone.js functionality to create a chordal sequencer and know how to use effects 
  - Implement sequencer logic from drums sequencer but instead of samples, have the sequencer generate sounds from inside the application. (no need for inner grid)
  - Create effects buttons to change the output sounds of the chords

### Day 3: 
   - Test all functionality
   - Style both sequencer and buttons in a more detailed way 
   - Work on the header containing the about model and my information
